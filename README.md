# Subnet-Scanner

This is just something I thought would be cool to make.

This utility scans a particular subnet for devices (Ex. Scanning the subnet 127.0.0.X)... and that's about it.

I had created the old variant around a year ago (2022) which is pretty slow, static, and lackluster compared to the newer version I have.
This new version supports some more error handling, multithreading, and a small cleanup utility.

It's all done in batch.

Performance is decent I'd say as long as multithreading is used, and I've tried to get an equally decent amount of documentation for this, but batch files, to me at least, are pretty gnarly to work with.
